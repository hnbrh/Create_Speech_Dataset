#Versions:
# 0.01  concept test
# 0.02  serialised librispeech - used parallel
# 0.03  added tedlium, added f_separate_transcript
# 0.04  cleaned up a bit and added comments
# 0.05  correct  bug in f_cleanup
# 0.06  added f_count_time to evaluate dataset total recording time and corrected small bug
# 0.07  added options to choose recording and transcription folders
#       correct bug in f_cleanup ("*" goes boom when too many files, replaced with some ls>temp fils)
#       correct bugs in f_tedlium
#       add a few double quotes
#       comment f_randomise_sets, still too prototypish
#       remove dataset.txt if it exists
#       update readme.md
#       made ffmpeg quite
#       added pv for tar progress
# 0.08  correct major release-blocking bug in f_librispeach
#       add current function status at end of file
# 0.09  most of TEDLIUM works, still a few lines with bugs somehow, and I don't know exactly why (left these in program output). if you know a more elegant way to define $startt and $stopt, please let me know!!!
# 0.10  polish f_separate_transcript and f_count_time polished and renamed f_cleanup to f_clean_dataset
# 0.11  add script and interactive mode
# 0.12  rename f_randomise_sets in f_custom_set, and rewrote the entire function
#		change options for added flexibility
#		start to include reproducability poc (not usable yet)
# 0.13  added f_runtime, allowing to know current runtime
# 0.14  correct f_runtime and added a bit of color
#		try to correct bug in f_tedlium (tried to send errors to /dev/null)
# 0.15  try to correct bug in f_tedlium (some points of dataset are not formatted right, replaced tabs with spaces)
# 0.16  correct bug in f_tedlium (check if $secs is a number before doing division, else skip and log line) - test is running, seems to finally be fixed!
# 0.17	change f_script and script options
# 0.18	correct small bug in f_custom_set


# TODO 
# rebuild f_randomise_sets to include a proper structure and logging and reproducability.
# add more datasets
# discover more bugs
# solve dirty line in TEDLIUM (help plz ^^)
# build datasets without mixing
